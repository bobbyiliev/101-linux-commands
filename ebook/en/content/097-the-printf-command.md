# The `printf` command

This command lets you print the value of a variable by formatting it using rules. It is pretty similar to the printf in C language.

### Syntax:
```
$printf [-v variable_name] format [arguments]
```

### Examples:
The format specifiers usually used with printf are stated in the examples below:

- %s

```
$printf "%s\n" "Printf command documentation!"
```
This will print `Printf command documentation!` in the shell.
