# The `xargs`command

The `xargs` command is used to build and execute commands from standard input. It reads items from standard input (or from a pipe) and passes them as arguments to another command.

Examples:

To delete files listed in a text file:
```
cat files.txt | xargs rm
```

To find all .txt files and copy them to another directory:
```
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs -I {} cp {} /path/to/directory
```

To run commands in parallel using multiple processes:
```
cat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 4 wget
```
Syntax:
```
xargs [OPTION] [COMMAND [INITIAL-ARGS]]
```
