# The `systemctl` command

The `systemctl` command is used to control and manage systemd services and the systemd system and service manager in Linux. It's the primary tool for managing services in modern Linux distributions.

## Syntax

```
systemctl [options] command [service-name]
```

## Common Commands

### Service Management
```
start [service]         Start a service
stop [service]          Stop a service
restart [service]       Restart a service
reload [service]        Reload service configuration
status [service]        Show service status
enable [service]        Enable service to start at boot
disable [service]       Disable service from starting at boot
```

### System Commands
```
reboot                  Restart the system
poweroff               Shutdown the system
suspend                Suspend the system
hibernate              Hibernate the system
```

## Options

Some popular option flags include:

```
-l          Show full output (don't truncate)
--no-pager  Don't pipe output into a pager
--failed    Show only failed units
--all       Show all units, including inactive ones
-q          Quiet mode, suppress output
-t          Specify unit type (service, socket, etc.)
```

## Examples

1. Start a service

```bash
systemctl start nginx
```

2. Stop a service

```bash
systemctl stop apache2
```

3. Check service status

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

4. Enable a service to start at boot

```bash
systemctl enable mysql
```

5. Disable a service from starting at boot

```bash
systemctl disable bluetooth
```

6. Restart a service

```bash
systemctl restart networking
```

7. Reload service configuration without stopping

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

8. List all active services

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

9. List all services (active and inactive)

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --all
```

10. List failed services

```bash
systemctl --failed
```

11. Show service dependencies

```bash
systemctl list-dependencies nginx
```

12. Check if a service is enabled

```bash
systemctl is-enabled ssh
```

13. Check if a service is active

```bash
systemctl is-active mysql
```

14. Restart the system

```bash
systemctl reboot
```

15. Shutdown the system

```bash
systemctl poweroff
```

## Service Status Information

When checking status, you'll see:
- **Active (running)**: Service is currently running
- **Active (exited)**: Service completed successfully
- **Inactive (dead)**: Service is not running
- **Failed**: Service failed to start

## Use Cases

- Managing web servers (nginx, apache)
- Controlling database services (mysql, postgresql)
- Managing system services (ssh, networking)
- Troubleshooting service issues
- Automating service management in scripts
- System administration and maintenance

## Important Notes

- Requires root privileges for most operations (use `sudo`)
- Services are called "units" in systemd terminology
- Configuration files are located in `/etc/systemd/system/`
- Always check service status after making changes
- Use `journalctl` to view detailed service logs

The `systemctl` command is essential for modern Linux system administration and service management.
