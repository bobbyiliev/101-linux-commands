## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

This book has been designed so that people can easily expand it.
To request us to review changes that you create, you will need to create a pull request.
Creating a pull request is described in
 [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

### File Location/Types

### [`ebook`](./ebook)

This directory holds all of the translations of the eBook.

### [`ebook/{LANG}`](./ebook/{LANG})

In the `ebook` directory we have the translations of the eBook in different languages.

If you are adding a new translation, make sure to make a copy of the `./ebook/en` directory and use the language code as the new directory name.

### [`ebook/{LANG}/content`](./ebook/{LANG}/content)

All the Markdown files for the '101 Linux commands' eBook are located within the [`content`](./content) directory for the specific language.

For example if you are adding a Bulgarian translation copy the `./ebook/en` folder to `./ebook/bg`, translate the `.md` files in the `content` directory and submit a PR.

### eBook Generation

The project uses [Ibis Next](https://github.com/Hi-Folks/ibis-next) developed by [Roberto Butti](https://github.com/roberto-butti), forked from the original [Ibis](https://github.com/themsaid/ibis/) by [Mohamed Said](https://github.com/themsaid).

Ibis Next supports generating PDF, EPUB, and HTML formats from Markdown content.

## Setup and Usage

```bash
composer install
```

1. Generate PDF (light theme):

## Contribution Examples

### Typical Git workflow

1. Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/101-linux-commands.git
cd 101-linux-commands
```

1. Create a dedicated branch for your changes.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-cli-example
```

1. While you work, check your status and stage files deliberately.

```bash
git status
git add CONTRIBUTING.md
```

1. Commit with a descriptive message and push your branch.

```bash
git commit -m "docs: add CLI contribution examples"
git push origin feature/add-cli-example
```

### Running the CLI locally

1. Move into the CLI workspace.

```bash
cd cli
```

1. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment. Use the command that matches your shell:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

1. Install the dependencies and the CLI in editable mode.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

1. Confirm the CLI works.

```bash
linux-cli --help
# or run directly without installation
python -m cli.cli hello greet --name "Linux Contributor"
# greet someone specific using the installed entry point
linux-cli hello greet --name "Linux Contributor"
```

### Adding a new command

1. Create a new command module inside `cli/commands/`. Example (`cli/commands/ping.py`):

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer(help="Ping command group")


@app.command()
def once():
    """Print a ping message."""
    typer.echo("pong")
```

1. Register the command with the main Typer app in `cli/cli.py`:

```python
from commands import hello, ping

app = typer.Typer(help="101 Linux Commands CLI ðŸš€")
app.add_typer(hello.app, name="hello")
app.add_typer(ping.app, name="ping")
```

1. Add or update tests in `cli/test_cli.py` to cover your new command. Mirror the existing `hello` command tests and update expectations.

1. Run the CLI manually to verify your command behaves as expected.

```bash
python -m cli.cli ping once
```

### Running tests

1. Ensure you're in the `cli` directory with your virtual environment activated.

1. Install the testing dependency if you haven't already.

```bash
pip install pytest
```

1. Execute the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

1. (Optional but encouraged) Run the additional quality checks that the workflow executes:

```bash
black cli/
isort cli/
flake8 cli/
mypy cli/
```
